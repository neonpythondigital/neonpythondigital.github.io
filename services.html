<h2>eCommerce store design & online marketplaces</h2>
<p>There are many elements to consider when deciding to sell your products online, but you must not neglect design. However, it is not just about the 'look' of the ecommerce store , it is about the complete user experience. The main goal is to ensure that purchasing an item is simple, easy and intuitive.</p>
<p>Navigation is highly important, i.e making it easy for the user to find the product they are looking for in a reasonable time.</p>
<p>Consistency is key, such as ensuring that the same fonts and colours are used throughout the store design.</p>
<p>Responsiveness is also highly important, and loading times can influence a purchase decision.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may already have a store on a marketplace site and would like some assistance with growing sales and engagement.</p>
<p>We can help you to make your ecommerce strategy more effective, whatever your chosen platform.</p>
